I have uploaded two files:
  1) pa1_skeleton.c - base assignment
  2) pa1_skeleton_bonus.c - assignment extended for bonus challenge.

I didn't plan to attempt the bonus challenge since I believed it would be too challenging. However, after completing the base assignment, I tried my hardest to attempt the bonus challenge as well. It is not polished code.

My statistics for reference (observed on CloudLab c220g5) :
